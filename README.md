THE CODE IN THIS PROJECT IS HORRENDOUS. IT IS HANDS DOWN THE WORST CODE THAT A MAN COULD EVER WRITE.

#Zef---The-interpreter-and-IDE-for-creative-coders

An IDE I built using C++ and QT Creator. In this repository you will
find the code for the whole project including the lexer, parser, interpreter 
and IDE all built using C++. The purpose of this language was to bridge the gap 
between code and result. Much like Processing, this language is aimed at rendering 
computer graphics with ease with a strong level of abstraction from rendering principles
of OpenGL. The IDE also features a live coding interface to see the result of code
instantly as it is being typed. The outcome is an IDE much like a sketchbook.

To run this you will need QT Creator. 
Import the project from the directory: /UI/zefIDE/zefIDE.pro
